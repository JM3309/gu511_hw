# Georgetown University Math & Statistics 511 **EXERCISES**

these notebooks are the exercises for the GU511 course. each of them will be
released in the 24 hours following our Thursday lectures and (unless otherwise
stated) will be due by the EOD on the following Friday. the due date will be
listed at the top of the notebook.

the method of submission for each assignment and what exactly is "due" will
change from assignment to assignment, but will be spelled out in detail in a
table at the top of every assignment.

## obtaining homework files

first, you should be able to view the contents of these files on github or
[using google
colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)

you only need to download these files if you want to run them in a local
`jupyter` server, and in almost all cases that won't be necessary. however, you
are welcome to do so if you'd prefer. there are a few ways:

### use `git`**

simply `git clone https://github.com/rzl-ds/gu511_hw.git` one time and obtain
all future updates by calling `git pull`

### download a single file

you can download any single *raw* notebook file.

*note*: the page you land on when you click the `hw##.ipynb` link is an `html`
document displaying the rendered that notebook. `jupyter` will not know what to
do with these files! you need to click the `raw` button at the top of the page
to access the raw `.ipynb` file
